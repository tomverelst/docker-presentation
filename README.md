# Docker & Tools by Tom Verelst

Docker allows you to package, distribute and run a piece of software, including everything it needs to run: code, runtime, tools, libraries – anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it​ will run and behave the same on any environment.

We will be showcasing the following Docker tools and features: Docker Engine, Docker Registry, Docker Compose, Docker Machine, Docker Swarm, Docker Networking

Next to introducing you to these tools, Tom Verelst will also be covering the following topics: Security, Containerisation, Immutable Infrastructure, Docker Orchestration, Continuous Integration with Docker
